Version 1.0.0 - March 14, 2016
------------------------------
Initial release, featuring special Logistics Rails that will enable you to turn your regular Cargo Wagons into Logistics Wagons.


Version 1.0.1 - March 15, 2016
------------------------------
Inserters are no longer forcibly disabled in the code; instead, wagons are now barred-out (all slots turned red) when they are interacting with the logistics network.
Wagons are now set to be non-minable and inoperable when interacting with the logistics network.


Version 1.0.2 - March 16, 2016
------------------------------
Fixed a possible bug with requester rails.


Version 1.0.3 - March 17, 2016
------------------------------
Fixed an issue which was causing vanilla straight rails to be unable to cross each other.
Fixed an issue where you could get stuck in a diagonal building mode and be allowed to place diagonal logistics rails -- this is now prevented from happening and you are snapped back to orthogonal if you try to place a diagonal Logistics Rail.
Fixed an issue where Logistics Rails could overlap -- overlapping can cause issues, and thus is disallowed.
Changed the blue ball icon for requester rails into a control panel icon.
